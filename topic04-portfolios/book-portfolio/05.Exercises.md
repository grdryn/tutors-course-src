# Exercises 


## Exercise 1:

Incorporate the module you generated in the earlier labs into the example portfolio you have just created. The following steps should suffice to do this:

- Copy/move the module into the portfolio folder (perhaps rename first to something unique)
- Edit `portfolo.yaml' to include the module in one of the subgroups we created in the last step
- Regenerate the portfolio and verify that it now includes the new module

## Exercise 2:

Try to publish the portfolio to a new github gh-pages site. Remember, you will be publishing the `portfolio/public-site` folder (not '/portfolio').
