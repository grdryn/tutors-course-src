# Module Grouping

This is the current portfolio.yaml:

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Module Group Label'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
      - tutors-starter-3
      - tutors-starter-4
~~~

Change it to this:

~~~
title: 'A collection of recent Modules in Modern Computer Science'
credits: 'Department of Computing & Mathematics, WIT'
courseGroups:
  - title: 'Alpha Group'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-0
      - tutors-starter-1
      - tutors-starter-2
  - title: 'Beta Group'
    modules:
      - tutors-starter-3
      - tutors-starter-4
~~~

Regenerate the portfolio again. This time the portfolio home should look like this:

The yaml file is sensitive to column positions, so make sure you indent (with spaces) as shown in the above examples.

The image + summary + credits for each module in the portfolio home page are read from each individual module files:

- course.jpg (can also be .png)
- course.md
- credits

Also note, the generated site is completely separate from the individual `public-site` as generated in each module.
