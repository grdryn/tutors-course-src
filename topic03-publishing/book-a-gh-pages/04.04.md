# C: Publish the Site to Github

Once linked - we can `push` a copy of all checked in files to the remote:

~~~
git push origin gh-pages
~~~

Now we are done - and the site will be published. The url for the site is:

- https://[YOUR-GITHUB-NAME].github,io/[YOUR-REPO-NAME]

For example:

- <https://edeleastar.github.io/tutors-starter-01/>

The site is now publicly available.
