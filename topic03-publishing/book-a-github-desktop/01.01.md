# Github Gh-pages

Github provides a convenient, free and rapid static public web site publishing facility called Gh-Pages

- <https://pages.github.com/>

This step assumes you have a github account, and git has been installed in your workstation.

Recall that tutors generates a static web site to the `./public-site` folder:

![public-site](img/01.png)

This folder is what we need to publish - not the 'source' for the course web. 
To publish a course web requires these steps: 

- Create the repository locally
- Commit all relevant files to the local repo
- Synchronise the repository with github

We will go through these steps now...
