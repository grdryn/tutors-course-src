# ajaxlabel.html

For each topic in the `public-site` folder, tutors will have generated a file called `ajaxlabel.html`:

There is one of these files for each topic.

The contents of this file will establish the link from a moodle topic to a github hosted site:

## Example ajaxlabel.html

~~~
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-11 col-md-11 col-sm-11">
      <iframe id="output" style="width: 100%;" frameborder="0" height="1200">
      </iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<script>

  $.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: '//wit-tutors.github.io/tutors-starter-public//topic01/indexmoodle.html',
    xhrFields: {
      withCredentials: false
    },
    success: function (data) {
      $('#output').contents().find('html').html(data);
    }
  });

</script>
~~~

There is no need to understand/edit or work with this file - we can use it exactly as is. However, please note that each topic has its own slightly different version - so you will need each of these in the procedures that follow.

And the procedure is:

1. Create Empty Topic in Moodle
2. Add a Label to the Topic
3. Copy `Ajaxlabel.html` into the label

This is illustrated in the next step...
