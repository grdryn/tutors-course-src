# Updating a Published Topic

To reinforce the nature of the binding between Moodle and gh-pages, try the following:

1. Create a new `talk` in the topic you have bound to gh-pages in the previous step (perhaps just duplicate an existing talk (on windows, copy/paste and rename), but give it a different image + text)
2. Generate a new version of the course using the tutors command.
3. Verify that the topic now contains the new talk.
4. Stage, commit and push the updated site to gh-pages
5. Refresh the moodle topic

The last step does NOT require you to edit the topic/label in any way - we can just wait for it to fetch the updated version when the caches have timed out.

The commands for doing this will usually be:

~~~
tutors
cd public-site
git add .
git commit -m "a description of the update"
git push origin gh-pages
~~~
