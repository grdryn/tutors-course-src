# Images

In Tutors, all images you wish to use must first be placed in the `img` folder in the current lab:

![](img/06.png)

The image can then be include in markdown using this syntax:

~~~
![](img/filename.png)
~~~

If you wish to have a title, you can insert it between the `[]` as in:

~~~
![Title](img/filename.png)
~~~

The is the above image with a title:

![Lab Folder Structure](img/06.png)

Image with a title:

![This is a Stone Arch](img/03.jpg)

Locate an image using google image search and see if you can incorporate into one of the lab steps. On most systems now you can just drag and drop from the browser directly into a folder open in Explorer (or Finder).
